Today we will be learning how to use Git and doing a basic introduction to Pandas in python.

Unfortunately I will not be here but Maryam will be taking over.

First, install python, jupyter notebook, and pandas on your computer. Then install VSCode or your editor of choice.

Then, go into the pac repo https://github.com/PennAerospaceClub/HAB-23-24 and clone the HAB 23-24 repository.
You might need permission access, let Maryam know to contact me if there are issues here.

Once you have this all set up, go into Pandas Tutorial.ipynb. Here, I have written the code necessary to import pandas and access
a test dataset. From here, I want you to dig through pandas documentation to find out how to answer the following questions.

1. What are the ranges of sepal_length, sepal_width, petal_length, and petal_width?
2. How many species are there and how many of each species are there?
3. Find the average sepal_length, sepal_width, petal_length, and petal_width by species. Which has the biggest petal size (length * width)?
4. Filter the dataset 
5. Find the ratio of the average petal size to the average sepal size by species and sort it from highest to lowest.
